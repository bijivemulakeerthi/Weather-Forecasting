# Weather Forecasting Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

Weather prediction is crucial in many fields with operations and protection requirements worldwide (Bag et al., 2022). In the recent past, the use of Machine learning (ML) algorithms has been implemented in the process of this forecasting with the foresight predictions being accurate. Previously, analysts utilized numerical simulations of the model to predict and this methodology rather posed some challenges in depicting pertinent aspects of the circulation in the atmosphere (Kochkov et al., 2024). Business forecasting is made accurate by machine learning because large data sets are analyzed to identify distinguishing features for prediction. Other factors that are important for the generation of the weather include humidity, pressure and clouds (Lakra and Avishek, 2022). The objective of this research is to explore the usage of ML in increasing meteorological prediction and the parameters that must be incorporated into consideration as well as the Integration of the most efficient algorithms. The increase in data access for weather data helps in enhancing refreshing and oversimplified Weather-based ML-based forecasting models for utility purposes across various sectors.
